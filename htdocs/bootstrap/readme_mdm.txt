2015/12/16 MDM This is a copy of the bootstrap-3.3.6/dist folder,
including assets for IE 10 workarounds, and a compatible version of jquery.

Our goals:
    stable fast website
    clear upgrade path

Therefore we keep a copy of bootstrap, but in its own folder.

We only store the bits that matter.  
FYI, I deleted the non-min'ed stuff from [dist]:

    js/bootstrap.js
    css/(4 non-min'ed files)

Now get on with it!  :-)
